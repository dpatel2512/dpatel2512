I am a MBA student at New York Institute of Technology, pursuing my passion for business administration and management. I have a bachelor's degree in finance from AURO University, Surat, where I graduated with honors. I am also a certified associate in project management (CAPMÂ®), demonstrating my knowledge and skills in leading and directing projects.

I have succesfully completed Triple ten bootcamp which covered Excel, data visualization (Tableau and Power BI), SQL, Business analytics key metrics and more. It also involved several practical projects. I also utilized Microsoft Excel and IBM Cognos Analytics to streamline financial data analysis and present key findings to the management team. I have a keen interest in how businesses from various industries use data to solve various problems and optimize their performance. I am eager to apply my analytical, operational, and attention to detail skills to a business analyst role in the future.
